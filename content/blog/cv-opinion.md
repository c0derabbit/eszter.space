Some would say I am quite passionate about CVs. Itʼs one or the other: either Iʼm nitpicking, or _most people_ are quite bad at writing them. Decide for yourself :)

But first, what does an _ideal_ CV look like? Quite simply, it enables me to decide in 3–5 seconds whether I want a call or not.

Iʼll tackle this by categories, and they are:
- format
- length
- aesthetics
- content:
  - personal information
  - experience
  - education
  - other

## Format

#### PDF
Most CVs I get are PDF. Thatʼs good, I would  say, thatʼs the best. Looks the same on all devices, can be emailed to someone, and so forth.

#### Online (a CV page on your website)
Not a bad solution, although looks like you want to be a little too unique by _not bothering_ to prepare and update a PDF.

#### No CV, Europass, LinkedIn only, and other formats
Come on, make a little effort and choose from the first two. And Europass doesnʼt count.

## Length

The longest Iʼve received for a mid-level frontend engineer position was 11 pages. ELEVEN. PAGES. What on Earth can span 11 pages in a non-academic CV?

A good CV is **one or two pages**, and well structured (more on that in the next point). Any longer than that, and I might not read it at all, not even skim it. At this stage, you really just have a couple seconds of the hiring managerʼs time!

## Aesthetics

A CV should look pleasant and readable, no matter what position you are applying to. This is even more true when you are a frontend engineer. Your _job_ is to make stuff on the screen look good. A simple and functional CV is your first chance to prove you are good at it.

## Experience

Thereʼs no such thing as _5+ years experience_. A company can look for someone with 5+ years, thatʼs different, but you either have 5 or 6, but not 5+. If I see 5+, I immediately know itʼs not more, because then you would write 6 or 7 or 12, right?
