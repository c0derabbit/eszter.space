# Now

<Timestamp prefix="Last updated:" date="27 January, 2020 (OMG It’s the future!)" />

**In life** I rediscovered the joy of preparing and eating simple and delicious food. Plus, Iʼve been watching lots of [Northern Exposure](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098878/). I also nurture an ever-growing collection of unfinished projects exploring server-side rendering, Electron, HTML canvas, Chrome extensions etc.

**At work** Iʼve been busy with React and Gatsby. Btw, we’re hiring [frontend devs](https://careers.fidel.uk/jobs/242473-front-end-engineer) in Lisbon!
