# Now

<Timestamp prefix="Last updated:" date="14 March, 2020" />

I recently started working remotely, and have been exploring the [various](/wfh) [aspects](/wfh-tips) of it, which I will keep writing about. Lately I’ve been tinkering again with a [server-side rendered weather app](https://github.com/c0derabbit/w2), and am working on a 1000-piece Moomin jigsaw puzzle.

Oh, and if you fancy working with me, [we’re hiring](https://careers.fidel.uk/jobs)!
