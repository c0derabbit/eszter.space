I’m Eszter, a frontend developer based in Scotland. I believe that form follows function, fast is accessible, and simple is beautiful. Sometimes I yap about something called usability.

When I’m not coding, I’m probably drinking coffee, watering plants, or learning how to longboard.

Say hi at `ekov at pm.me`.
